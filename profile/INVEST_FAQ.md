## Investor FAQ — MindPrism

**1. What stage is MindPrism at right now?**
We are pre-seed: the core architecture and technical design are complete, and prototype modules and demo flows are in development. We are building our founding team and preparing for pilot integrations.

**2. What is MindPrism’s main product and who is it for?**
MindPrism is an explainable AI platform that turns every answer into a transparent, step-by-step reasoning graph.
Our target users:

* Enterprises (compliance, audit, finance, HR, law)
* Educators and EdTech
* Healthcare and research
* Developers and AI builders needing transparent, auditable logic

**3. What is your business/revenue model?**

* SaaS API: Core reasoning engine as a closed SaaS platform, open for third-party plugins and reasoning templates.
* Marketplace: Licensing of “audited” or premium reasoning modules.
* Audit-as-a-service: Certified auditor partners for critical domains.
* Enterprise/compliance plans: Integration, governance, and support for regulated clients.
* Revenue share for community contributors.

**4. How do you compete with Big Tech or LLM providers?**
MindPrism is open, modular, and focused on explainability from the ground up—unlike LLMs, which are “black box” by default.
We are building the “HuggingFace for reasoning”—a community platform for reusable, pluggable, and auditable logic that complements, rather than replaces, generic LLMs.
Openness, community network effects, and domain coverage are our key differentiators.

**5. What are the main risks for this project?**

* Complexity: Ensuring reasoning graphs remain usable and actionable.
* Community growth: Bootstrapping an active ecosystem of pattern creators.
* Quality control: Verifying and auditing reasoning patterns at scale.
* Monetization: Balancing openness with sustainable SaaS/API revenue.
* Team: Attracting and scaling a multidisciplinary founding team.

(For more, see “Risks & Mitigations” section in our White Paper.)

**6. Is MindPrism open source? Can companies extend or build on it?**
The reasoning engine and APIs are provided as SaaS (not fully open-source), but anyone can build and plug in their own reasoning modules or templates.
Community and marketplace logic are open, with premium and audited flows available for licensing.

**7. What’s your go-to-market (GTM) plan?**

* Early pilots with compliance-driven enterprises and educators
* “Community-first” growth: enable developers, auditors, and experts to share and monetize patterns
* Open API, seamless integration with existing AI, LLM, and enterprise tools
* Marketplace to drive long-term ecosystem adoption

**8. How do you ensure quality and trust in community reasoning modules?**

* Dual status for modules: “audited” (verified by experts/licensed auditors) and “community” (use at your own risk)
* Audit trails, transparent reviews, automated logic checks
* Clear marking in UX and governance guidelines for regulated industries

**9. How big is the market opportunity?**
Explainable AI (XAI) is projected to be a \$20B+ market by 2030, with growing demand due to regulatory pressure in finance, healthcare, education, and the public sector.
MindPrism aims to be the core “reasoning layer” powering trusted AI in these high-value domains.

**10. What are your next key milestones?**

* Complete core prototype and run first pilot integrations
* Launch community reasoning pattern library and marketplace
* Secure early reference customers and strategic partners
* Expand the founding team and prepare for a seed round

**11. What do you need from investors right now?**

* Early capital to accelerate product development and pilots
* Strategic guidance on GTM and business model refinement
* Network introductions for pilot customers and domain experts
* Support in building a top-tier founding team
